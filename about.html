		<p> Jeffery is a stout pug but is actually considered to be smaller than the average pug. The average weight of a pug is supposed to be around 22 lbs.
		Jeffery is much skinnier than the average pug, which also makes him more athletic and active. His head is also abnormally small but it just makes me love him more. </p>
