		<p> I have always loved pugs since I was a kid and always wanted one of my own. I bought him for myself as a 21st birthday present.
		I had to look for almost two years before I found a pug puppy that was in my price range. I only saw him once before buying him and I still believe there isnt a better dog on the planet.
